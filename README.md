## Problem Statement:
Despite advances in medical research and treatment, diabetes remains a major public health concern. Diabetes is a chronic medical condition that affects millions of people worldwide and can lead to various complications such as cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, nerve damage, and blindness. Although diabetes can be managed with proper medical care and lifestyle changes, prevention is always the best action. Therefore, there is a need for an advanced system that can predict the likelihood of a person developing diabetes based on their health data and risk factors. The Diabetes Prediction System is one such system that can provide early warning signs of diabetes, help healthcare providers personalize treatment plans, and help patients better understand their risk of developing diabetes. However, there are limitations to the system, such as the accuracy of the system's predictions may be impacted by the quality and quantity of the data it receives. Additionally, the system may not be able to account for all risk factors or health data that could impact a patient's risk of developing diabetes. Therefore, researchers are working to improve the accuracy of the system's predictions and develop new algorithms and machine learning models to predict the onset of diabetes better.

## Abstract :
This project aims to develop a diabetes prediction system that uses machine learning algorithms to accurately and efficiently predict the likelihood of developing diabetes using easily accessible health data. The system should be user-friendly, secure, and comply with healthcare regulations
to protect patient privacy. By improving early detection and intervention for diabetes, this system aims to promote healthy lifestyle choices and reduce the burden of diabetes on individuals and society.

## Introduction:
The  Diabetes Detection Analysis and Visualization System is a machine learning-based system that aims to predict the likelihood of a person developing diabetes based on their health data and risk factors. This system is intended to help healthcare providers, and individuals better understand their risk of
developing diabetes and take proactive measures to prevent or manage the condition.
