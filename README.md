## Problem Statement:
Diabetes is a chronic condition affecting millions worldwide and can lead to various complications despite advances in medical research and treatment. Prevention is the best action, and an advanced system like the Diabetes Prediction System can predict the likelihood of developing diabetes based on health data and risk factors. The system can provide early warning signs, personalize treatment plans, and help patients understand their risk of developing diabetes. However, limitations exist, such as the impact of data quality and quantity on the system's accuracy, and the inability to account for all risk factors. Researchers are working to improve the system's predictions with new algorithms and machine learning models.

## Abstract :
This project aims to develop a diabetes prediction system that uses machine learning algorithms to accurately and efficiently predict the likelihood of developing diabetes using easily accessible health data. The system should be user-friendly, secure, and comply with healthcare regulations to protect patient privacy. By improving early detection and intervention for diabetes, this system aims to promote healthy lifestyle choices and reduce the burden of diabetes on individuals and society.

## Introduction:
The  Diabetes Detection Analysis and Visualization System is a machine learning-based system that aims to predict the likelihood of a person developing diabetes based on their health data and risk factors. This system is intended to help healthcare providers, and individuals better understand their risk of
developing diabetes and take proactive measures to prevent or manage the condition.
